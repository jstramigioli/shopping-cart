                This is a mock shopping website created as part of a React learning exercise. 
                Feel free to browse the store, add items to your cart, and experiment with the 
                shopping featuresâ€”but keep in mind, this isnâ€™t a real shop! No actual purchases 
                can be made here.
            </h2>
            <h3 className={styles.description}>
                The goal of this project is to practice React concepts like routing, state 
                management, and API integration. Have fun exploring, and thanks for stopping by!
